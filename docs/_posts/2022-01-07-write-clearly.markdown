## using plain language

### By Marianne Holtman

#### What is plain language?

It is simple, unpretentious language that communicates clearly so your reader can immediately understand what you mean. 

#### Why is plain language now a worldwide trend?

Communicating clearly using plain language is increasingly recognised as the most professional, responsible and efficient way to share business or government information.

  * It inspires trust and confidence
  * It respects readers whose first language may not be English
  * It is considerate as it saves your audience’s time and prevents misunderstandings

### 1O STEPS TO SIMPLIFY AND STRENGTHEN YOUR COPY FROM HUH? TO AHA!

* THINK AND PLAN BEFORE YOU START WRITING
  * Figure out the main messages and essential info
  * Arrange your thoughts and move words, sentences and paragraphs around until your work flows in a clear, logical order

* GET TO THE POINT QUICKLY
  * Place your main messages upfront
  * Include background information and context after the main points

* KEEP YOUR AUDIENCE IN MIND
  * Know who your audience is and what they need or want to know
  * Don’t assume your audience will read to the end (or even the middle)
  * Use language, references and examples your audience will understand and relate to

* KEEP SENTENCES SHORT
  * Aim to include only 1 or 2 ideas and fewer than 25 words per sentence
  * Make sure the verb is near the beginning of the sentence, where possible
  * Split long sentences that contain lots of extra details, phrases or clauses into two sentences. Put the details in the second sentence

* MAKE PARAGRAPHS SHORT AND INVITING
  * Aim for 2 or 3 sentences per paragraph
  * Vary the length of your sentences to create a lively rhythm
  * Include very short sentences of 1 to 5 words to add punch 

* USE SIMPLE, CONVERSATIONAL WORDS
  * Avoid jargon and formal, stuffy language
  * Use a friendly, warm and human tone
  * Don’t try to impress or intimidate by showing off your vast vocabulary and long, complex sentence constructions

    Examples of short words that work better:
    * **extra** instead of **additional**
    * **so** instead of **consequently**
    * **if** instead of **in the event of** 
    * **before** instead of **prior to**
    * **now** instead of **at this point in time**
    * **try** instead of **endeavour**
    * **must** instead of **is incumbent on**
    * **until** instead of **until such time as**
    * **monthly** instead of **on a monthly basis**
    * **start** instead of **commence**

   Unless it’s a legal doc, avoid these musty words:
      afore-mentioned, henceforth, hereafter, hereby, herewith, thereafter, thereof, therewith, wherein, whereof

* USE MUSCULAR VERBS
  * Inject energy into your copy by avoiding ‘smothered’ noun-verbs (long nouns derived from short verbs)

  Example: 
  Instead of ‘help with the maintenance and sustainability of the project’, say ‘help maintain and sustain the project’
  Instead of ‘make an application for a loan’, say ‘apply for a loan’

  * Use the active voice instead of the passive voice (where appropriate)
      
  Example: 
  Instead of ‘Your donation is appreciated by us’, say ‘We appreciate your donation’

* KEEP IT CONCISE
  * Declutter your copy by avoiding repetition and deleting unnecessary words

* CREATE SHORT, PUNCHY HEADLINES
  * Grab your audience’s attention with short, lively words in your headline

* LET YOUR TEXT BREATHE
  * Plain language is not just about keeping your text simple. It’s also about presenting your text in a clear way
  * Insert space between paragraphs
  * Use sub headings
  * Make use of bullets and lists
  * Avoid using very wide columns
